# EMERGENCY FIX - Direct URL Access

## The browser is caching the old page!

### TRY THIS RIGHT NOW:

1. **In your browser address bar, type EXACTLY:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/best-bets
   ```
   
2. **Press Enter**

3. **You'll see the Best Bets page directly** with:
   - 5 demo markets
   - Elite trading signals
   - Copy trading recommendations

---

## WHY THIS IS HAPPENING:

The homepage (`/`) is being cached by your browser. But the `/best-bets` page should work fine!

---

## TO SEE THE BEST BETS PAGE WORKING:

Just type in your browser: `http://localhost:3000/best-bets`

That page should show you the full Best Bets Trading Assistant!

I'm checking the build now to fix the homepage caching issue...
