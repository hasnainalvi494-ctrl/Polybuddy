# 🎯 CRITICAL: How to See the Best Bets Button

## ✅ GOOD NEWS: 
**The Best Bets button IS working!** I can see it in your Cursor browser screenshot (image 2) - it's the **yellow button at the bottom** that says "🎯 Best Bets Trading Assistant ✨"

## 📍 WHERE TO FIND IT:

### In Your Regular Browser (Image 1):
**SCROLL DOWN!** The button is below the "View Top Traders" and "Find Arbitrage Opportunities" buttons.

Looking at image 1, I can see:
1. Hero section with headline
2. Three feature cards (Top Traders, Arbitrage Scanner, Whale Alerts)
3. Two green buttons at the bottom
4. **YOU NEED TO SCROLL DOWN MORE** to see the Best Bets section

### What You Should See When You Scroll:

After those two buttons, there should be a **GIANT YELLOW BANNER** with:
- 🎯 "BEST BETS" in huge text
- Yellow background and borders
- Stats cards
- Massive buttons

## 🔧 QUICK FIX - Try This:

### Option 1: Hard Refresh
1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** (clears cache)
2. **Scroll down** past the green buttons
3. Look for yellow banner

### Option 2: Clear Cache Manually
1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Delete**
2. Clear "Cached images and files"
3. Reload page
4. Scroll down

### Option 3: Use the Navigation
1. Look at the **TOP NAVIGATION BAR**
2. You should see menu items
3. Is there a "Best Bets" or "Elite Traders" link?
4. Click it to go directly to the page

## 🎯 DIRECT LINKS:

Instead of scrolling, you can go directly to these pages:

1. **Best Bets Page**: 
   - Type: `http://localhost:3000/best-bets`
   - Press Enter

2. **Elite Traders Page**:
   - Type: `http://localhost:3000/elite-traders`
   - Press Enter

## 📱 IN CURSOR BROWSER (Image 2):

I can see the button at the bottom! It says:
