## Product Vision

PolyBuddy aims to be a retail-focused prediction market analytics platform that helps traders make informed decisions on Polymarket.

### Core Thesis

Retail traders systematically lose in prediction markets because they lack tools to understand:
- Market structure and dynamics
- Professional/whale activity patterns
- Behavioral signals that indicate favorable conditions

### Target User

Individual retail traders who want:
- Honest assessments of market conditions
- Warnings about unfavorable situations
- Signals that identify potentially favorable opportunities
